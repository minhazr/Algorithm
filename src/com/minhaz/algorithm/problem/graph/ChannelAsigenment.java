 * There are M transmitter and N receiver stations. Given a matrix that keeps
 * track of the number of packets to be transmitted from a given transmitter to
 * a receiver. If the (i; j)-th entry of the matrix is k, it means at that time
 * the station i has k packets for transmission to station j. During a time
 * slot, a transmitter can send only one packet and a receiver can receive only
 * one packet. Find the channel assignments so that maximum number of packets
 * are transferred from transmitters to receivers during the next time slot.
