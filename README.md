Algorithm
=========

When first time I start working with different algorithims, I got overwhilmd by different advance techniques and creative solutions of an Algorithim. At that moment I was struggling with algorithim itself. So, most algorithim I implemented here are not highly optimized rather simple implementation of problem itself and the way my bain understands it.  

Please consider these solutions as psudeo code in Java which also work as a complete program. 

I will keep updating the list when i get chance to add more.
